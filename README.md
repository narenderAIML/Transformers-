# Transformers-NLP

Transformers these are the deep learning models like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) the transformers are designed for handling the sequential data, such as natural language,
for tasks like translation and text summarization. The main aim of transformer is to solve sequence to sequence task while handling long range dependencies with ease.
